# The Original CR10 Marlin Firmware Source


###### *This is the ORIGINAL Creality CR10 Firmware Source as Creality installs it.*

There have been a lot of complaints about Creality not releasing their sources, so... *here it is.*

The only files that have been edited are DOGMbitmaps.h files to remove the Creality3D logo.

No other changes have been made. It is *exactly what Creality installs on the CR10 Melzi.*

**I will not be making any other changes to this repository.**

Below is a copy of the License portion of the Marlin Firmware readme, and the reason why this mirror exists.

More information about Marlin Firmware can be found at [MarlinFW.org](http://marlinfw.org) and on their Github page [here] (https://github.com/MarlinFirmware).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](https://github.com/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
